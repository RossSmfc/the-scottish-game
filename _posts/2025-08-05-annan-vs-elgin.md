What a start to the League Two season! Annan and Elgin played out a dramatic 2-2 draw that saw two red cards, a missed penalty, and a 94th-minute equaliser.

Annan looked confident early on, taking a first-half lead through a bullet header from defender Greg Fleming. But Elgin responded before the break with a low finish from Kane Hester.

A second-half red card for Annan’s Scott Hooper put them on the back foot, but substitute Aidan Smith appeared to have won it late for the home side. Elgin, however, weren’t done — a chaotic corner in stoppage time led to an own goal, sending the away fans wild.

It’s early days, but League Two looks *very* tasty this season.

**Final score:** Annan 2–2 Elgin
